# excel-music-player
This is a music player coded in VBA, there are still some issues and it seems it has a problem with the memory, it has problems running on Excel 32 bits.
(I wanted to do a music player in Excel but I didn't know how to start so I found a project on Internet and I started working based on the project code I found on the Internet, modifying it according to my needs, so it would be great if you check the original project on which I based. You can look for it by "bulevardi excel mp3 player".)
